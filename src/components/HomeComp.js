                    <p>
                        It's the weekend <br/>
                        Just an intermission <br/>
                        Monday's around the bend <br/>
                        And so are the palpitations <br/>
                        Can't drink with a friend <br/>
                        In no mood for socialization <br/>
                        Movies never end <br/>
                        Trouble with concentration <br/>
                        Got a weekend to spend <br/>
                        But I'm a stranger to relaxation <br/>
