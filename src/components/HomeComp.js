                    It's the weekend <br/>
                    Just an intermission <br/>
                    Monday's around the bend <br/>
                    And so are the palpitations <br/>
                    Can't drink with a friend <br/>
                    In no mood for socialization <br/>
                    Movies never end <br/>
                    Trouble with concentration <br/>
                    Got a weekend to spend <br/>
                    But I'm a stranger to relaxation <br/>
